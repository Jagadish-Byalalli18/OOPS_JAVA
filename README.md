# 📘 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) in Java

## 1. OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System)
OOPS is a programming approach in Java where we design applications using classes and objects that represent real-world entities.  
It helps make code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

---

## 2. Class
A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) of an object.

- Logical entity  
- Does not occupy memory by itself  

---

## 3. Object
An object is a real-world instance of a class.

- Multiple objects can be created from a class  
- Occupies memory  
- Can perform actions

## 4. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of binding data and methods together and hiding internal data.

### Why:
- Protects data  
- Allows controlled access  



## 5. Abstraction
Abstraction means showing only essential features and hiding implementation details from the user.

### Why:
- Reduces complexity  
- Improves flexibility  
- Makes code easier to use and modify  

---

## 6. Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.

### Why:
- Enables code reuse  
- Reduces duplication  
- Improves maintainability  

## 7. Polymorphism

Polymorphism means one method behaving differently in different situations.

### Why:

Supports dynamic behavior

Enables loose coupling

Improves flexibility

### Types:
Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)


## 8. Interface

An interface in Java is a contract that defines what a class should do, but not how it does it.

### Why:

Achieves abstraction

Supports multiple inheritance

Enables loose coupling
